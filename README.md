This is a Pokedex app that fetches from a Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/) and displays each Pokemon in a simple "list of buttons" format.

Fetch and promise pollyfills have been added for older browser and IE support.

Added features:
1.) Dropdown Bootstrap navbar.
2.) Clicking a Pokemon button now applies a border with a type-based color. "fire" type Pokemon would get an orange border, etc...
3.) In the navbar dropdown there is a totalizer that keeps track of how many pokemon you've clicked on ("caught") so far.
